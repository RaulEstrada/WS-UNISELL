intro=Introduction
intro.message=ADSW Airlines is an airline that provides high quality air traveling services at very economic prices so that everyone can go the distance and enjoy their well deserved holidays or attend that important business meeting anywhere in Spain with flights leaving every airport every day.
private=Private Zone
private.message=ADSW Airlines contains a private zone available only to registered users where they can manage their account. Moreover, while any user can search flights and destinations, only registered users can register bookings, manage their accounts, see the orders they have registered and cancel any future order.
how.works=How does it work?
how.works.message.1=Any user can look for destinations in the 'Destinations' menu, where they will find images of those destinations. In the 'Search flights' menu option, users can look for flights in order to book them, but in order to move forward with the booking process they will have to sign in.
how.works.message.2=Signing up is free and very easy. The system only needs a little information and you are ready to go with lots of additional services.
how.works.message.3=Once you have signed in and selected the flights you want to book, the system will generate the different tickets (one per passenger and per flight), and will ask you to introduce the name of the passenger for each ticket.
how.works.message.4=Then, you can optionally add one additional booking service, such as booking a car, or booking a van, or adding additional baggage (as many baggages as you desire). Then, you register the booking and the system will show you a summary.
how.works.message.5=You can send a notification email for each of the bookings made. Moreover, in the 'My orders' menu you can see all the bookings you've made, sending summary emails again and cancelling future bookings.
notifications=Notifications
notifications.message=When the system displays the bookings summary, you can choose to send a notification. You can do this from the 'My orders' menu as well. When you cancel a booking, an automatic notification is sent to you. Notifications are sent via email. If you choose to send an email, the email from your user account is used.

top.flights.message=Below you can see a relation of the top 5 most popular destinations based on bookings made
